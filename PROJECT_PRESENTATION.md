Welcome to The Traitors' Castle!

The dark shadows of the castle have stirred once more... The Traitors have struck again, and a Faithful has been "murdered" during the night. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to discover which Faithful has fallen and remove them from the list.

Are you ready to unveil the mystery and bring justice to the Faithful?

Steps to Solve the Mystery:

Prepare Your Tools: Open your terminal and run the following command to set up your environment:

**npm install**

Enter the Castle: Navigate to the main.js file. This is where you will write the function to help identify and remove the murdered Faithful from the list. Your task is to ensure the remaining Faithfuls stay vigilant by updating the list.

Your function will need to:
- Accept an array of Faithfuls' names. e.g. ["Leanne", "Livi", "Fozia", "Maia", "Jake"]
- Identify which Faithful has been murdered.
- Remove that Faithful from the list.
- Return the updated list without the murdered faithful.

Victory Awaits: Once you've successfully identified the murdered Faithful and updated the list, you will have completed your mission! Check that you are successful by opening your terminal and running the following command

**npm test**

But bewareâ€”if you make a mistake, the Traitors might strike again...
